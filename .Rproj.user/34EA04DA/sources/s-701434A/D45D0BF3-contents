# fastshap

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **fastshap** is to provide an efficient way to compute the approximate Shapley values discussed in [Section 5.8.3.3 of Christoph Molnar's IML book](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html). 

**WARNING:** This package is a work in progress and the speed is likely to improve further over time.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **fastshap** from GitHub:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("bgreenwell/fastshap")
```

## Example

The following example demonstrates the basic usage of the **fastshap** package.

```{r compute-shap, cache=TRUE}
# Load required packages
library(fastshap)  # for fast (approximate) Shapley values
library(mlbench)   # for Friedman 1 benchmark data set
library(ranger)    # for fast random forest algorithm

# Simulate training data
set.seed(101)
trn <- as.data.frame(mlbench.friedman1(3000))
X <- subset(trn, select = -y)  # feature columns only

# Fit a random forest
set.seed(102)
rfo <- ranger(y ~ ., data =  trn)

# Prediction wrapper
pfun <- function(object, newdata) {
  predict(object, data = newdata)$predictions
}

# Compute fast (approximate) Shapley values using 10 Monte Carlo repititions
system.time({  # estimate run time
  set.seed(5038)
  shap <- fastshap(rfo, feature_names = names(X), X = X, pred_wrapper = pfun, 
                   nsim = 10)
})

# Results are returned as a tibble (with the additional "shap" class)
shap
```

You can use the results to interpret the model in many different ways. For example, in the code chunk below we take the sum of the absolute value of the Shapley values within each feature to construct a Shap-based feature variable importance plot:

```{r shap-importance, fig.width=6, fig.asp=0.618, out.width="70%"}
# Load required packages
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())

# Aggregate Shapley values
shap_imp <- data.frame(
  Variable = names(shap),
  Importance = apply(shap, MARGIN = 2, FUN = function(x) sum(abs(x)))
)

# Plot Shap-based variable importance
ggplot(shap_imp, aes(reorder(Variable, Importance), Importance)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("mean(|Shapley value|)")
```

We can also plot the Shapley values for each feature to construct Shap-based dependence plots:

```{r shap-dependence, fig.width=6, fig.asp=0.618, out.width="70%"}
shap_dep_x3 <- data.frame(x3 = X[["x.3"]], shap = shap[["x.3"]])
ggplot(shap_dep_x3, aes(x3, shap)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth() +
  ylab("Shapley value")
```

You can also use `autoplot()` to construct simple plots:

```{r shap-autoplot, fig.width=6, fig.asp=0.618, out.width="70%"}
p1 <- autoplot(shap)
p2 <- autoplot(shap, type = "dependence", feature = "x.3", X = X)
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

### Parallel execution

Since **fastshap** uses the **plyr** package under the hood, you can use any parallel backend supported by the **foreach** package. This is illustrated in the code chunk below.

```{r shap-parallel, cache=TRUE}
# Load required packages
library(doParallel)

# Set up parallel backend
registerDoParallel(5)

# Compute Shapley values in parallel
fastshap(rfo, feature_names = names(X), X = X, pred_wrapper = pfun, nsim = 10, 
         .parallel = TRUE)
```
